### Mock API
MirageJS simulates a realistic backend with:
- 200-1200ms latency
- 5-10% error rate on write operations
- Pagination and filtering
- 25 seeded jobs and 1000 candidates

### Design System
Modern, professional design with:
- Indigo/purple primary color scheme
- Semantic color tokens for status indicators
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Responsive layouts
- Dark mode ready
